# Evaluation

A Dependability evaluation is performed for the 2 systems.

### Functionality Evaluation

1. **Correctness**:
   - **Verification**: Ensure the system performs the intended functions correctly.
   - **Validation**: Test whether the system meets the requirements and specifications.

2. **Reliability**:
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Assess how well the system handles errors and continues to operate under failure conditions.
   - **Recovery**: Check the system's ability to recover from failures and restore normal operation.

3. **Availability**:
   - **Uptime**: Measure the time the system is operational and available for use.
   - **Maintenance**: Evaluate how maintenance procedures impact system availability.

4. **Safety**:
   - **Error Handling**: Verify the system's ability to manage errors safely without causing harm to users or other systems.
   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that data is not corrupted and is handled securely.

### Performance Evaluation

1. **Efficiency**:
   - **Resource Utilization**: Measure how effectively the system uses resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
   - **Throughput**: Evaluate the amount of work done in a given time period.

2. **Scalability**:
   - **Load Handling**: Test how well the system performs as the load increases.
   - **Performance Under Stress**: Assess the system’s performance under peak load conditions.

3. **Latency**:
   - **Response Time**: Measure the time it takes for the system to respond to requests.
   - **Delay Analysis**: Evaluate any delays in processing or communication.

4. **Reliability**:
   - **Error Rate**: Monitor the frequency of errors or failures.
   - **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Calculate the average time between system failures.

5. **Benchmarking**:
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the system’s performance with similar systems or with predefined benchmarks.
